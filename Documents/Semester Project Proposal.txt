Title: Peer-to-Peer File Sharing
Team Members:
- Joey Maffiola
- Nelson Cowan
- Adam Kessler

Project Description:
The project will be a simple (and hopefully efficient) P2P file sharing program. The goal is to allow users to find, share, and download files amongst peers without relying on a centralized server.

Minimum Viable Product (MVP): 
- Share files between two or more users
- File Chunking / Parallel Downloads
- Implement a file sharing protocol
- Bandwidth Throttling
- Download percentage / progress bar

Stretch Goals: 
- File Size Limit
- File Integrity Checking
- Peer Discovery Mechanism
- File Discovery Mechanism
- Fractional Bandwidth Splitting
- Folder / directory sharing
- File Encryption
- Anonymity

Network Architecture and Specifications:
- Architecture: P2P
- Protocol(s) Used: TCP
- Data Protection Measures: End-to-End encryption
- Multi-threading

User Stories:
1. As a file sharer, I want to be able to go online such that other users can download the files I select.
2. As a file sharer, I want to allow people to download my files while also being able to use my network for other purposes.
3. As a file downloader, I want to be able to access files on users' systems that they have made available.
      
Deliverables: 
- Source code for send-receive architecture 
- Documentation for all methods, classes, etc
- Documentation of sender and receiver instructions and sender receiver guidelines
- Working demo of P2P file sharing in action
- If a central searching server is made, a working demo of such a server.

Final Notes:
As a user of P2P file sharing when I was a teen, I have always wondered how it worked. How can multiple people "seed" while I download one file from multiple sources? I'm finally going to find out with this project! I believe the challenge in this project will be handling users' data safely. Installing some form of encryption, let alone End-to-end encryption should be a challenge. This will be my first foray into networking and multi-threading, so that should be exciting.
